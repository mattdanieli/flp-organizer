# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Pattern colour now actually applies in FL Studio.** v1.5.2 wrote
  events with the wrong event ID (149 instead of 150) and with the byte
  order reversed (B, G, R instead of R, G, B). These were inserted into
  the file but FL Studio quietly ignored them. v1.5.3 uses the correct
  event ID (`ID_PATTERN_COLOR = 150`) and the correct byte order
  (R, G, B, alpha).
- Added a `_decode_color_payload` helper so colour-event payloads are
  consistently decoded as canonical `0xRRGGBB` integers regardless of
  the file's little-endian byte order. Both `ID_CHANNEL_COLOR` (128)
  and `ID_PATTERN_COLOR` (150) go through it.

### Notes
- Reverse-engineered with a tiny test project: a one-pattern .flp with
  the pattern's colour set to `#7F0010` (Maroon) revealed the byte layout
  `7F 00 10 00` at the right offset for event ID 0x96 (150). The
  previous tentative ID (149) turned out to be a different DWORD-typed
  event whose payload happens to look colour-like.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Auto-color now also colours pattern clips.** v1.5.1 wrote
  `ID_PATTERN_COLOR` (event 149) only when an existing colour event was
  found, but most patterns in real projects have no such event by default.
  v1.5.2 inserts a new `ID_PATTERN_COLOR` event right after each
  `ID_PATTERN_NEW` (event 65) for patterns that lack one, so the rainbow
  hue is applied to all groups regardless of clip type (audio or pattern).

### Technical
- New `_color_inserts` list in `AnalysisResult`, applied alongside
  `_name_inserts` in the writer pass that grows the file. The FLdt chunk
  size is updated to reflect the total inserted bytes.
- Each inserted event is 5 bytes: `0x95` (ID 149) + 4-byte little-endian
  DWORD `0x00 BB GG RR`.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Auto-color now actually applies to clips.** v1.5.0 wrote colour bytes
  to the playlist tracks, but FL Studio doesn't reliably honour those
  bytes (the override flag is missing for the very first track). v1.5.1
  changes strategy: it writes a perceptually-distinct rainbow colour to
  each group's source channels and patterns (`ID_CHANNEL_COLOR` event 128
  and `ID_PATTERN_COLOR` event 149). Since clip colour in FL Studio comes
  from the source channel/pattern, this is what users actually see.
- Improved default-colour detection: a heuristic (`_is_default_color`)
  identifies FL Studio's auto-assigned greys (low saturation and low
  luminosity) so user-picked colours are preserved while drab defaults
  get overwritten.

### Other
- All v1.5.0 features remain (preserve muted tracks, preserve clip-level
  mute, auto-rename tracks). Only the auto-color implementation changed.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Preserve muted tracks.** Clips from originally-muted tracks are placed
  into a dedicated group of muted tracks at the bottom of the playlist
  (labelled `[muted] ...` in the preview). Tracks that used to be muted but
  no longer contain muted content are reactivated automatically.
- **Preserve individual clip mute (ghost clips).** The "X" marker on single
  muted clips is preserved when those clips are moved to new tracks.
- **Auto-color (rainbow)** (opt-in checkbox). For each group, the source
  channels and patterns get a perceptually-distinct rainbow colour. This
  colours the **clips** in the playlist (because clip colour comes from the
  source channel/pattern in FL Studio). Custom colours that the user has
  manually picked are preserved — only auto-assigned default greys are
  overwritten. (Note: this is different from colouring the playlist tracks
  themselves, which FL Studio handles via a separate mechanism that proved
  unreliable to write to.)
- **Auto-rename tracks** (opt-in checkbox). Each destination track is
  renamed to match its group (e.g. `Kick Basic.wav` or `Pattern 24`).
  Implemented by inserting `ID_TRACK_NAME` (event 239) entries after each
  `ID_TRACK_DATA` and updating the FLdt chunk size.

### Technical
- Reverse-engineered on FL Studio 25.1.6:
  - Track mute: byte 12 of `ID_TRACK_DATA` payload (`0x01` active / `0x00` muted).
  - Clip mute: bit 5 (`0x20`) of byte 19 in the 80-byte playlist item.
  - Channel colour: `ID_CHANNEL_COLOR` (event 128), 4-byte DWORD `0x00RRGGBB`.
  - Pattern colour: `ID_PATTERN_COLOR` (event 149), same layout.
  - Track name: `ID_TRACK_NAME` (event 239), UTF-16LE null-terminated.
- Heuristic `_is_default_color`: identifies FL Studio's auto-assigned greys
  (R, G, B all under 0x70 with low spread) so user customisations are kept.

### Roadmap
- **v1.6.0**: remove empty tracks, custom colour palettes for groups.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Sort by color** — new sub-sort modifier that orders groups by a
  perceptual rainbow hue (red → orange → yellow → green → blue → purple).
  Greys go in the middle, uncoloured groups at the end.
- The color of a group is the most frequent color among its source
  channels or patterns (majority wins).
- Core now parses `ID_CHANNEL_COLOR` (event 128) and `ID_PATTERN_COLOR`
  (event 149). `ClipInfo` exposes a new `color` field.
- CLI: `--sub-color` is now fully functional.

### Roadmap (coming in v1.5.0)
- Auto-rename tracks from group names
- Auto-color tracks
- Remove empty tracks
- Preserve muted track state (strada B from v1.3.x discussion)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Language selector dropdown was invisible because the top-bar frame was
  placed on the same grid row as the header, causing the header to overlap
  and hide it. The layout now reserves a dedicated row for the language
  selector above the header.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Batch mode** — process up to 30 .flp files in one run. New "Single file /
  Batch" tab selector at the top. In batch mode you can choose a custom output
  folder or leave the default (outputs saved next to each input).
- **Sub-sort modifiers** — checkboxes that refine the primary track order:
  - *Group by type*: audio clips come before patterns.
  - *Sort by clip length*: groups with longer clips first.
  - *Sort by color* (placeholder, coming soon).
  These combine freely with both Alphabetical and By-first-appearance.
- **Post-process options card** with checkboxes for upcoming features
  (auto-rename tracks, auto-color tracks, remove empty tracks). These are
  visible but disabled ("coming soon") and will be implemented in v1.4.0.
- **Multi-language UI** — language selector in the top-right corner. Choose
  between English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano, and Русский. The
  choice is persisted in `~/.flp_organizer_config.json` and remembered across
  launches. All labels, captions, buttons, status messages, and the disclaimer
  text are translated.
- CLI: `--batch`, `--output-dir`, `--sub-length`, `--sub-type`, `--sub-color`.

### Changed
- CLI now accepts multiple input paths; existing single-file usage is
  backwards-compatible.
- Default window size slightly larger (920×780) to fit the new controls card.

### Technical
- New module `src/translations.py` holding every UI string for 6 languages.
- `flp_core.analyze()` and `flp_core.reorganize()` accept an optional
  `sub_sort` list argument.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Disclaimer dialog buttons ("I agree" / "Decline") no longer get clipped off
  the bottom on some display configurations. Dialog is now larger (620×500),
  resizable with a minimum size, and the buttons reserve fixed space at the
  bottom.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Custom app icon bundled into the executable (taskbar + window title bar).
- Centred header at the top: icon + "FLP" (orange) + "Organizer" (white) +
  version.
- First-launch disclaimer popup clarifying that FLP Organizer is independent
  and not affiliated with Image-Line.
- Footer with "Made with 🧡 by Matt Danieli" and a "Help me build more tools"
  button that opens a donation link in the browser.

### Changed
- Window is now fully resizable without buttons disappearing (grid layout).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Two sorting modes selectable from the GUI:**
  - Alphabetical (A–Z)
  - By first appearance
- CLI accepts `--sort alpha` or `--sort first`.

### Changed
- Dark FL-Studio-inspired theme with orange accents.
- GUI rebuilt around standard ttk widgets for stability on Windows.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Initial release.
- Drag & drop GUI for Windows (also runs on macOS / Linux from source).
- Byte-level surgical patching: modifies only track-index bytes, leaves
  everything else untouched.
- Auto-detection of playlist item size (supports FL Studio 21, 24, 25).
- Grouping by sample name / channel name / pattern name.
- Lane assignment for overlapping clips of the same group.
- Alphabetical sorting (case-insensitive).
- Preview pane before applying changes.
- Threaded analysis/write with progress bar.
- Safety: refuses to overwrite the input file.
- Python library API (`flp_core`) for scripting / batch use.
- Command-line interface (`cli.py`) for headless / batch processing.
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic Windows release builds.
